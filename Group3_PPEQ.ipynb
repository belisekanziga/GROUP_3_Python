    "### Project Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to automatically generate a directory structure for AIMS-Rwanda students using pure Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Inputs:\n",
    "1. **Course List CSV** – one course name per line.\n",
    "2. **Student List CSV** – each line in the format:\n",
    "   `last_name, first_name`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Expected Outputs:\n",
    "- A main working directory named: `AIMS-Rwanda-Workspace`.\n",
    "- Inside it: one folder per student in the format: `Lastname, Firstname`).\n",
    "- Inside each student folder: one subfolder per course.\n",
    "- Inside each course folder: an empty `README.txt` file.\n",
    "- Existing folders/files are **never overwritten**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Additional Requirements:\n",
    "- Validate CSVs exist and are not empty.\n",
    "- Normalize names, that is, remove accents and special characters.\n",
    "- Handle letter case for program to run regardless of lower/upper/mixed case.\n",
    "- Add a simple main menu to allow re-running or quitting.\n",
